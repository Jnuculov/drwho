				<p>The eleventh Doctor was portrayed by Matt Smith, who was introduced at the conclusion of the show's New Year's Day special in 2010. Smith portrays the eleventh such incarnation, a quick-tempered but compassionate man whose youthful appearance is at odds with his more discerning and world-weary temperament.</p>
				<p>Although Steven Moffat expected to pick a middle-aged actor for the new Doctor, Smith was aged 26 when cast. This made him the youngest actor to portray the Doctor, three years younger than Peter Davison was at the time he began his role as the Fifth Doctor. Smith is scheduled to portray the character past the show's 50th anniversary and until at least 2014.</p>
